Speaking at London JS Algorithms

##Â Before the event

Please provide the following at least 2 weeks in advance of the event:

- A good quality photograph of yourself
- A one-sentence abstract that answers the question: what will I learn from this presentation?
- Links to any reading material students should review beforehand
- Some excercises that students can work through together (e.g. https://github.com/LondonAlgorithms/PokerHands)
- Email these to danieljohngrant@gmail.com or post them to the [Slack group](https://github.com/LondonAlgorithms/PokerHands) - ideally you'll share your exercises a little while before the event and get feedback (this will help iron out any issues or stumbling blocks)

## Talk prep

Remember, that you will be talking to an audience of mixed abilities. Some will have will be unfamiliar with advanced Maths and CS concepts. 

Try to:

- Keep the presentation as accessible as possible
- Make the first challenge easy (so everyone gets a foot in the dorr) and let subsequent challenges become more challenging
- Provide helpers to abstract away any code that it is not related to the algorithm or too complicated for a 1 hour dojo

Here's a few tips to keep your presentation accessible:

- Pause to explain any terms or concepts that would be unfamiliar to a non-expert
- Prefer programming notation over mathematical notation
- Explain difficult concepts slowly and repeat your explanation
- Ask questions and extract answers out of the group
