Speaking at London JS Algorithms

##Â Before the event

Please provide the following at least 2 weeks in advance of the event:

- A good quality photograph of yourself
- A one-sentence abstract that answers the question: what will I learn from this presentation?
- Links to any reading material students should review beforehand
- Email these to danieljohngrant@gmail.com

## Talk prep

Remember, that your audience will have mixed abilities. Some will have will have never studied algorithms before whilst others may be Maths grads!

- Keep the presentation as accessible as possible
- Make the first challenge easy and let each subsequent challenge build upon the former
- Provide helpers to abstract away any code that it is not related to the algorithm or too complicated for a 1 hour dojo

However, clever you think members of the audience are going to be, keep your presentation simple and don't over-prepare!

Here's a few tips to keep your presentation accessible:

- Pause to explain any terms or concepts that would be unfamiliar to a non-expert
- Prefer programming notation over mathematical notation
- Explain difficult concepts slowly and repeat your explanation
- Ask questions and extract answers out of the group
